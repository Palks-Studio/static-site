# Palks Studio — Professional Static Website Foundation

> This repository is a technical presentation and documentation repository.  
> It does not contain downloadable source code or production files.

A complete static website base designed to serve as a **clear, autonomous, and long-lasting foundation**  
for professional or technical projects.

This foundation is intended for **developers, integrators, and technical teams**  
who want to keep full control over their code,  
without relying on heavy frameworks, CMSs, or third-party services.

---

## Project Goal

This project provides a **clean and maintainable HTML / CSS structure**  
to quickly launch a serious, readable, and scalable website.

It is **not a fixed visual theme**,  
but a **solid technical foundation**, designed to be:  

- quickly understood  
- easily customized  
- extended without unnecessary complexity

---

## What the Foundation Includes

The project includes:  

- Multiple fully structured HTML pages  
- A clear and coherent site architecture  
- Organized, commented, and modular CSS  
- A heading hierarchy aligned with SEO best practices  
- ARIA attributes and accessible content  
- A `robots.txt` file  
- A `sitemap.xml` file  
- Clear in-code comments for customization  
- A straightforward usage license

No external dependencies are imposed.

## Included Pages

The foundation notably includes:  

- Home  
- About  
- Approach  
- Resources  
- Links  
- Contact  
- Terms of Use  
- Legal Notice  
- Privacy Policy

Each page includes:  

- its own SEO meta tags  
- a consistent structure  
- generic, ready-to-adapt content

---

## Accessibility

Particular attention has been paid to accessibility:  

- Proper semantic hierarchy  
- Structured headings (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`)  
- Screen-reader-only text (`visually-hidden`)  
- ARIA attributes where relevant

This foundation provides a healthy base for projects that care about accessibility.

---

## SEO

The foundation is optimized for search engines:  

- `title` and `meta description` tags per page  
- Open Graph and Twitter Cards  
- Canonical URLs  
- Sitemap  
- Robots.txt

Content is intentionally generic and must be customized  
before any final production deployment.

---

## Quick Customization

To adapt the site to your project:  

- Replace the logo in `assets/img/`  
- Edit the text content in the HTML files  
- Adjust colors in `:root`  
- Adapt or extend the existing CSS  
- Add JavaScript scripts if needed (optional)  
- Icons, favicons, and logos are not provided and must be added by the user

By default, CSS is embedded directly into the pages.

An option allows loading styles from an external file  
(`/assets/css/style.css`): the `<link>` line is already present  
but commented out and can be enabled at any time.

---

## What This Project Is Not

This foundation **is not**:  

- a CMS  
- a turnkey consumer website  
- a visual page builder  
- a JavaScript framework

It is intended for technical users  
or teams looking for a clean and fully controlled starting point.

---

## Philosophy

This foundation prioritizes:  

- clarity over visual effects  
- readability over over-optimization  
- code ownership over opaque automation

It is designed as a **foundation**, not as an end product.

---

## Support

No support is included.

This project is intended for users who can:  

- read and understand HTML / CSS  
- adapt the content to their needs  
- manage their own deployment

---

## Conclusion

If you are looking for a reliable, clean, and durable base  
to start a professional static website,  
this foundation was designed to save you time  
without sacrificing quality or understanding.
